Custom React PropType validators that we use at Airbnb. Use of [airbnb-js-shims](https://npmjs.com/package/airbnb-js-shims) or the equivalent is assumed.

 - `and`: ensure that all provided propType validators pass
 - `childrenHavePropXorChildren`: ensure that either all children have the indicated prop, all children have children, or all children have neither.
 - `childrenOfType`: restrict the prop to only allow children of the given type.
 - `componentWithName`: restrict the prop to only allow a component with a certain name/displayName.
 - `forbidExtraProps`: pass your entire `propTypes` object into this function, and any nonspecified prop will error.
 - `mutuallyExclusiveProps`: provide a propType, and a list of props, and only one prop out of the list will be permitted, validated by the given propType.
 - `nChildren`: require a specific amount of children.
 - `nonNegativeInteger`: require that the prop be a number, that is 0, or a positive integer.
 - `or`: recursively allows only the provided propTypes, or arrays of those propTypes.
 - `range`: provide a min, and a max, and the prop must be a number in the range `[min, max)`
 - `restrictedProp`: this prop is not permitted to be anything but `null` or `undefined`.
 - `uniqueArray`: this prop must be an array, and all values must be unique (determined by `Object.is`). Like `PropTypes.array`, but with uniqueness.
 - `uniqueArrayOf`: `uniqueArray`, with a type validator applied. Like `PropTypes.arrayOf`, but with uniqueness.
 - `withShape`: takes a PropType and a shape, and allows a shape to be enforced on any non-null/undefined value.

## Production
Since `PropTypes` are typically not included in production builds of React, this libraryâ€™s functionality serves no useful purpose. As such, when the `NODE_ENV` environment variable is `"production"`, instead of exporting the implementations of all these prop types, we export mock functions - in other words, something that ensures that no exceptions are thrown, but does no validation. When environment variables are inlined (via a browserify transform or webpack plugin), then tools like webpack or uglify are able to determine that only the mocks will be imported - and can avoid including the entire implementations in the final bundle that is sent to the browser. This allows for a much smaller ultimate file size, and faster in-browser performance, without sacrificing the benefits of `PropTypes` themselves.

## Tests
Simply clone the repo, `npm install`, and run `npm test`
